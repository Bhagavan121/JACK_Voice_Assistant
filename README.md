# JACK_Voice_Assistant
This is the era of Artificial Intelligence. In this period intelligent toys were born.
They are started learning, reacting according to the situation and understanding human emotions. 
In this process we are building a Voice Assistant called JACK. As we know Python is an emerging language so it becomes easy to write a script for Voice Assistant in Python.
The instructions for the assistant can be handled as per the requirement of user. 
Speech recognition is the process of converting speech into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.
In Python there is an API called Speech Recognition which allows us to convert speech into text. It was an interesting task to make my own assistant. 
It became easier to send emails without typing any word, searching on Google without opening the browser, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music,
opening your favourite IDE with the help of a single voice command. In the current scenario, advancement in technologies are such that they can perform any task with same effectiveness or
